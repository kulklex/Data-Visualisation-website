**Data Visualization Website**

This website focuses on the data visualization of football data, encompassing actual match results, 
generated predictions by AWS SageMaker, and sentiment analysis based on news data for five
football teams.
The football teams include Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.


**Website Features and Technology**
Public S3 link: https://footballdatalandingpagebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Typescript: The code for uploading the numerical and text data was written in TypeScript. 

Football data is extracted from a CSV file, processed, and then stored in the DynamoDB database. 

Text data is extracted from News API, processed into sentiments, then stored in DynamoDB.

Numerical Data Display: Fetching the stored numerical data from DynamoDB, and then
visualizing it with Plotly's JavaScript for insights into five football teams' stats. The data is split into 
actual and predicted sections. Predictions generated by AWS SageMaker's DeepAR algorithm. 
Both the actual data and predicted data are plotted together on the same line-chart graph but 
separated by distinct traces for easy comparison.

Sentiment Analysis Display: The sentiment analysis of each team is visualized using pie charts. 
They are generated through processed text data from the News DynamoDB table. This analysis 
utilizes an API from text-processing.com to create sentiments, offering a clear visual 
representation of public sentiment towards each team.

WebSockets: When the page loads, the client requests data from the server using WebSockets. 
The server then sends the data back through the same channel. If cloud data changes, the server 
broadcasts these updates to all connected clients via WebSockets, ensuring real-time data 
synchronization.

Serverless: The website makes use of AWS serverless features by handling backend tasks 
without the need to manage servers through Lambda functions. Lambda functions are 
automatically triggered by changes in specific DynamoDB tables.

Cloud-Based Infrastructure: All project data is stored in the cloud, leveraging AWS S3 
serverless technology for hosting the website.

Machine Learning: Using Deep AR algorithm with AWS Sagemaker to train and test five teamsâ€™
football data and synthetic data to help predict future match outcomes. Created training jobs for 
each team and synthetic data, created models for them, then used created endpoints to store the 
predictions of each team in DynamoDB.

Front-end: Frontend was created using pure HTML and JavaScript, while styling was done using 
Tailwind CSS.

**Lambda Functions**
processSentiments: This lambda function is triggered after there is a change in the News 
DynamoDB table. It uses text processing.com API to convert text data into sentiments. It then 
saves the sentiment in a new table called Sentiments.
wsConnect: This lambda function manages the websocket connection events.
wsDisconnect: This lambda function manages the websocket disconnection events.
wsDefault: This lambda function is the default websocket connection events.
wsMessage: This folder contains three files consisting of a websocket.mjs file, database.mjs file, 
and index.mjs file. It leverages lambda, an API Gateway, and DynamoDB to create that serverless 
system for real-time communication via WebSockets. It processes incoming WebSocket 
messages, queries and manipulates data in DynamoDB based on these messages and sends 
responses back to clients. The setup includes functionality for sending messages to specific 
clients, handling disconnects by cleaning up connection IDs in DynamoDB, and fetching as well 
as processing team-based data and sentiments for response messages.
plotSyntheticDataFromEndpoint: This lambda function uses AWS SageMaker to invoke a 
machine learning model for synthetic data predictions. It retrieves original data via an Axios 
request, uses SageMaker to retrieve the predicted data, then visualizes both sets of data using 
Plotly.
broadcastForSentiment: This lambda function uses websockets to broadcast new sentiment 
data added to the Sentiments DynamoDB table.
broadcastConnectedIDs: This lambda function uses websockets to broadcast new numerical 
data added to the FootballMatches DynamoDB table.
DynamoDB Tables
FootballMatches: Stores all numerical data for each team extracted from the CSV file.
FootballNews: Stores all text data for each team, gotten from News Api.
Sentiments: Stores the processed text data results as sentiments.
WebSocket: Stores all websocket connection IDs.
PredictedResults: Stores the predicted football results.
